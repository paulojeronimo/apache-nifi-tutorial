For me, the best way to start learning a new technology is by running all the stuff related to them inside a {docker} container.
By this way, I can abstract myself about the related installation procedures and go directly to the point.

So, In this tutorial, I present the steps to work with Apache NiFi using Docker.

== Prerequisites

. {Docker} installed.

== Start/Restart

First start:

----
docker run --name nifi -p 9090:9090 -d -e NIFI_WEB_HTTP_PORT='9090' apache/nifi:latest
----

Restart (if was started any time before with the command below and stopped):

----
docker start nifi
----

== Access to the UI

Open http://localhost:9090/nifi

== Status

----
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                                   NAMES

----
docker stop nifi

----
$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                        PORTS               NAMES
