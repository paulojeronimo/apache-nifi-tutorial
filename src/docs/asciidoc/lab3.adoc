= Lab 3: {lab3-title}

== Prerequisites

. Docker installed.

== Step 1 - Create a Nifi docker container with default parameters

----
$ docker run --name nifi -p 8080:8080 -d apache/nifi
----

== Step 2 - Access the UI and create two processors

Open http://localhost:8080/nifi

== Step 3 - Add and configure processor 1 (GenerateFlowFile)

Drag and drop a processor into canvas:

Add it to the canvas:

image:lab3/06.png[]

Configure the `Directory` property to `/tmp/nifi`.

image:lab3/07.png[]

Configure `Automatically Terminate RelationShips` by checking the boxes `failure` and `success`.

== Step 5 - Connect the processors

From `GenerateFile` to `Putfile`:

image:lab3/09.png[]

A connection will be create:

This will be the final state:

== Step 6 - Start the processors

Click kbd:[Ctrl] to select both processors and start it.

== Step 7 - View the generated logs

Open a shell inside the container:

----
$ docker exec -it nifi /bin/bash
----

Type the following command to see a list of the 9 generated files.
This list will be actualized second by second.
As we configure in NiFi, a new file will be generated on every 5 seconds.

----
$ while :; do clear; ls -lht /tmp/nifi/ | head -10; sleep 1; done
----

== Step 8 - Stop the processors

Click kbd:[Ctrl] to select both processors and stop it.

== Step 9 - Stop and destroy the docker container

----
$ docker stop nifi
$ docker rm nifi
----

== Conclusions

* NiFi UI is very simple and intuitive.
* The properties are well documented.
* Many other aspects of the UI can be explored in {uri-nifi-youtube-playlist-a}[this playlist].
